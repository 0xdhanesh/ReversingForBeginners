## Recommended Advanced Sections for Your Notes

- **Input/Output Mapping**
    
    - Track all ways the binary processes input (argv/env/files/network).
        
    - Note formats, validation routines.
        
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG) Analysis**
    
    - Record observations about function relationships and execution paths (from Ghidra/r2/IDA output).
        
- **Decompilation Insights**
    
    - Summarize logic from Ghidra decompiled pseudocode.
        
    - Annotate pseudo-C outtakes for complex checks or algorithms.
        
- **Vulnerability Patterns**
    
    - Note buffer overflows, format string bugs, UAFs, integer issues, etc.
        
    - Log any unsafe memory functions found (e.g. gets/strcpy/sprintf).
        
- **Exploitability Analysis**
    
    - Assess mitigations bypass, ROP gadgets, how to control EIP/RIP.
        
    - Record gadgets found (ropper, ROPgadget output).
        
- **Patch/Crack Documentation**
    
    - Steps for patching binaries (radare2, hex editor, Ghidra Patch).
        
    - Record offsets and bytes changed.
        
- **Network/IPC Analysis (if relevant)**
    
    - Log observed sockets, IPC, protocol fuzzing.
        
- **Debugging Artifacts**
    
    - Record breakpoints, watchpoints, memory dumps, and why they matter.
        
- **Exploit PoC Section**
    
    - Commands or scripts for exploitation (python, pwntools, C).
        
    - Annotate steps and expected outputs.
        
- **Obfuscation/Anti-Analysis Section**
    
    - Document VM tricks, anti-debug/anti-disasm, packers, entropy checks, etc.
        
- **References & Theory**
    
    - Add links to CVEs, research papers, related CTFs, documentation.
        
- **Lessons Learned**
    
    - End each analysis with what techniques worked, what you missed early, and what skills you want to sharpen.

**Summary:**  
Your checklist is already strong; adding these deeper analysis sections helps you:

- **Think like an exploit developer**
    
- **Spot new attack surfaces**
    
- **Document methods for future, harder binaries**
    

This is what sets advanced researchers apart!
